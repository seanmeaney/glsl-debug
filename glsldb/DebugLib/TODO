- streamRecording.h and streamRecording.c looks like hand-written but
  can be generated. There is ArgSizeFuncs.pl in generator/ which is
  probably template for this action. It must be checked and extended
  for full autogeneration.
- DBG_STREAM_HINT must be rewritten without this #define thing. It generates a lot
  of work for preprocessor. We can define it using compiler as const array of 
  functions and enum states.

- Optimisation. Debug lib takes too long to generate. It reading file each time
  new script called. We must parse files and build database first, then use it directly.

- beginEndFunctionsTest is a tool to get functions allowed in begin-end blocks
  its output for some old videocards in generator/functions directory.
  The right way to do this is compile beginEndFunctionsTest, then run it to 
  get list of functions using user current videocard, and then pass it to
  compilation scripts. But this is not good variant for distro maintainers, so 
  other way is implement some scripting interface to pass this thing during the
  executing phase.
  
- pre- and postExecute. There a few functions and a lot of code in generator for this.
  It will be great to move this things to lambdas and control this with init scripts.
